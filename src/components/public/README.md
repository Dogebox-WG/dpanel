# Public Components

This directory contains components (custom-elements) available 
for use within Pups.

As an example, a "Dogebox Profile widget" allows Pup authors 
to display user profiles with little effort.

These components are made available via the dogebox-toolkit 
which is responsible for configuring and managing the iframe 
context and communication between Pup and Parent (dpanel).
